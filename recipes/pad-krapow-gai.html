      <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup sliced shallots</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar,
        and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir
        fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high
        heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the
        pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and
        stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed
        the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the
        meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds.
        Serve with rice.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
